Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **str** | Namespace of the rating targets. This is provided because external services might have targets with collisioning IDs. For example service A might have product with id 1, and service B product with also id 1. This attribute makes it possible to separate those two products. All external service which use this API should agree on unique namespaces. For example all food products register could have namespace: &#x60;food-products&#x60;.  | [optional]
